            "I click the 'Download All Invoices' button and it just spins indefinitely. I've tried multiple times.",

            "I noticed I was charged twice for the same service in March. Invoice #INV-3847 and #INV-3891 both show $49.99 for 'Premium Plan'.",
            
            "Yes, I can see that INV-3847 is dated March 3rd and INV-3891 is March 17th. But I should only be charged once per month, right?",
            
            "Oh! I see. So the March 17th charge was for upgrading from Basic to Premium mid-cycle?",
            
            "That makes sense now. I forgot I upgraded halfway through the month. Sorry for the confusion!",
            
            "No other issues. You've been incredibly helpful today with the login problem, the invoices, and now explaining the billing.",

            "Good morning! Remember helping me yesterday with login and billing issues?",

            "Interesting. Do you know if your engineering team is working on a fix? I really prefer using LastPass for security.",
            
            "That's great to hear! Can I sign up to be notified when the fix is released?",

# Reroute Guidelines

## Overview
Rerouting allows customers to redirect in-transit packages to alternative delivery addresses.

## Availability
- Package must still be in carrier's possession (not out for delivery)
- Available for domestic shipments only
- Not available for international orders
- Carrier must support address change (check carrier capabilities)

## Valid Alternative Addresses
- Customer's verified alternate address on file
- Workplace address (requires business name and hours)
- Pickup location (UPS Store, FedEx Office, etc.)
- Friend/family address (requires recipient consent)

## Restrictions
- Cannot reroute to PO boxes (if original was street address)
- Cannot reroute across state lines for some carriers
- Cannot reroute to addresses flagged as high-risk

## Process

1. **Verify Package Status**:
   - Check tracking: must show "In Transit" status
   - Confirm carrier supports reroute
   - Ensure package not already out for delivery

2. **Validate New Address**:
   - Confirm address format and completeness
   - Verify address through carrier API
   - Check for delivery restrictions

3. **Submit Reroute Request**:
   - Update order destination in database
   - Submit change request to carrier API
   - Transaction must be atomic: update order + create ticket + log audit

4. **Confirmation**:
   - Send confirmation email with new address and ETA
   - Update tracking information
   - Set follow-up reminder for delivery confirmation

## Fees
- Free for premium customers
- $5 fee for standard customers (waived for late shipments)
- Same-day reroute: additional $10 fee

## Special Cases

- **Business hours**: Confirm business delivery hours for workplace reroutes
- **Secure locations**: Additional verification for high-value items

## System Updates Required
- Update order.destination field
- Set order.status to "REROUTE_REQUESTED"

# Replacement Policy

## When to Offer Replacements

Replacements are the preferred resolution method for:
- Damaged items upon delivery
- Wrong item shipped
- Missing items from order
- Late shipments (when reroute not possible)
- Defective products within 30 days

## Replacement Process

1. **Verification**: Confirm customer account and order details
2. **Eligibility Check**: 
   - Order placed within last 90 days
   - Customer has not exceeded replacement limit (3 per year)
   - Item still in stock
3. **Shipping Method**:
   - Standard replacement: 5-7 business days
   - Expedited replacement: 1-2 business days (for late shipments or premium customers)
4. **Original Item**:
   - Damaged/wrong items: customer must return within 14 days
   - Late shipments: no return required if original arrives late

## Customer Preferences

Check user profile for shipping and resolution preferences:
- `replacements_over_refunds`: Customer prefers replacement to refund
- `expedited_shipping_only`: Always use fastest shipping
- `eco_friendly`: Use consolidated/slower shipping when possible

## Cost Considerations
- Free expedited shipping for late deliveries
- Customer pays return shipping for change-of-mind returns
- All shipping free for defective/damaged items

## System Requirements
- Update order status to "REPLACEMENT_PROCESSING"
- Create new order record linked to original
- Set expedited flag if applicable
- Create return authorization if needed
